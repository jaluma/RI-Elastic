It turned into day drinking. A whiskey at 8am was no problem. I was up to two or three bottles of spirits, two or three bottles of wine and a dozen or so beers a week. \n\nI didn\u2019t see this as a problem. I didn\u2019t get drunk and fall over. No hangovers. No vomiting. (Ok maybe once or twice.)\n\nI\u2019m remarried now. And have a new baby. We\u2019re a family gain. Yet drink rules my life. NO. I\u2019m done. It has made me into a liar.

BUT now I'm drinking regularly. I am in my 40s and last year my mother was diagnosed with cancer. So between traveling back and forth to her and trying to spend time with my husband, the alcohol became a nice wind down and let loose once a week. My husband would smoke a joint and I would drink 6 pack of wine coolers while sitting out back during the summer. Then I decided that the wine coolers weren't that high in alcohol content and just sugar! So I switched to a bottle of red wine. Then I started drinking earlier on Saturdays, my drinking time became 4PM instead of 8 or nine, and because of that I needed 2 bottles of wine. Now I find myself wanting it all the time and 4 pm is now 3 pm. And today is the first time I'm drinking on a work night! Tomorrow is a big event at work and I've been on vacation all week. I've been letting loose every other day. And here I am polishing off a bottle and a half of wine, my reasoning is, it's still earlier, I can feel fine in the morning. I think overall it has to do with the sugars and not just the alcohol... but still. I want to add... I've never felt guilty about drinking. I have always been able to do whatever I needed to the next day. I don't cancel plans. I know in my mind what an alcoholic is...\n\nBut I still wonder... am I becoming one?",
