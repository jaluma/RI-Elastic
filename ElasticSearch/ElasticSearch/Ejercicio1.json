         "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo some backstory: I quit drinking one month ago (30 days sober as of today). I would say that I was a functioning alcoholic. I mean that in the way that I wouldn't drink every day or get black out drunk. But I did drink about 4/5 days a week, mostly wine and beer, and when I drank I couldn't stop at just one glass of wine or one beer. I would also often drink alone. So I am aware that I am not one of those people who can drink occasionally a glass of wine. When I drank I always craved more. So I quit drinking a month ago, haven't had any withdrawal symptoms, but I do crave alcohol from time to time. \n Also about a month ago I met a new guy, and we have been on several dates so far, and talked about being exclusive and both wanting a serious relationship. I wouldn't say I am in love with him, but I do like him a lot and look forward to what may come out of it. The problem is I knew his mother died 3 years ago (he is 30, I am 29), but recently he told me that she died of alcoholism. She had been an alcoholic his whole life and because of it during part of his childhood he lived with his grandmother. She also had been in and out rehab, tried to quit several times, etc. the whole story. Moreover, he never met his father, so despite all this, his relationship with his mother was quite close.\nSo, since I have just met him and I didn't want to scare him away, I haven't told him yet about my problems with alcohol. Now I am even more afraid that knowing my struggle with alcoholism will scare him away, but at the same time I feel that it is unfair to keep it a secret from him, given his past. I feel like I should tell him, because I feel like, given his mother's story, we would not want to get involved with someone like me. \n\nSo my question is: what would you do if you were in my place? Would you tell him right away in case he didn't want to pursue a relationship with someone like me? or would you wait to see how things go?\n\ntldr; I quit drinking a month ago, my new boyfriend (been dating for one month) just told me his mother died of alcoholism. Have not told him yet about my struggle with alcohol. Not sure if I should tell him now or wait.",

When I smoked pot, got panic attack, developed panic disorder, dp/dr(derealization/depersonalization), anxiety stuff. I went sober then, and went to meds and benzos(&lt;---fuck benzos)\n\nI managed somehow to control my attacks without benzos, I *ONLY*(not meant to be used daily, but my doctor said it was not a problem) took them for sleep since 2011. Not anymore. GABA receptors were being attacked them. I started drinking again in 2013, when I got panic under control, just DR/DP left. And I fucking found that drinking relivied it. So I drank like 3-5 times a week, until I went 5-7 a week or the maximum I went, 18 days straight fucking binge drinking.\n\nNow, a former lawyer, no more university, I have no job, I'm housebound, I'm going to lose my driver license because I was caught driving under the influence of alcohol (not drunk, different things ok? Here in Brazil, low concentrations are influences only, like 2, 3 beers.) I'm also addicted to a benzodiazepine called Clonazepam.\n\nHere my \"sober\" story starts. I take this drug everyday. 0.5mg, when I do not drink. 1mg-3mg mg when I'm hangover (glutamate rebound and doc. said it was ok, they have no clue, it's not), but then I was 6 days today without drinking and FUCK. I couldn't stand. I'm not a weak \"boy\". I had tremors, shaking, DP/DR, anxiety, almost a full blown panic attack, I just didn't panic because I knew this was the alcohol withdrawal. I thought \"Victor, this is your 6th day without drinking in YEARS. It's a body reaction.\" And I drank 5 long neck beers today to ease me, and now I'm going to sleep with the aid of clonazpeam.I don't want to be ALCOHOL FREE forever, I know for a while I will be, But, I don't know how to do it. I have the willpower to not drink when I don't. I know I fucked up with binge drinking during 5 years. But I think I can't do it cold turkey, too much suffering, too much pain, too much HELL.

We talked about drinking early on in our relationship and decided we saw too much negative in drinking and we generally don't drink.  Socially maybe every other month.  However part of that has been with our neighbor, one of my friends who is a hard core alcoholic.  Hard. Core.  She drinks all night, sleeps till 5 or 6 pm.  Her spouse is very unhappy and I know from our private conversations that dumping her is on the table, but she has invested so much, she is reluctant to pull the trigger.\n\nSkip ahead, I am becoming bothered by the fact she texts my spouse (he's a gay man, she's a lesbian) at 3AM to come drinking.  Not that anything came of it as he slept through it, but I am bothered by the fact she thought it was appropriate.  We are neighbors, which kind of exacerbates this.\n\nLast weekend she texted at 1AM when we were still awake, but I still think this was not something \"decent\" people should do.  It had been a month since we had anything to drink so I begrudgingly said let's go, he ended up staying and drinking till 10AM.\n\nI feel like she wants to groom him to be her drinking buddy.  She probably perceives me as being able to support us both just as her wife does, so they can while away the nights drinking.  I told him before we went that I wouldn't have alcohol change our plans again (of course the next day is lost after a night of drinking).\n\nMy question is has anyone seen this grooming behavior before, where someone detects a predisposition to drinking as my husband has and tries to exploit it?  I am considering saying we can't socialize with them any more because you can't ask an alcoholic to be responsible with alcohol in any way, certainly not because it will harm someone else.  This has blindsided me, though it's not truly a problem yet, it's bothering me a lot.  I hate to end a marriage in short order, but I won't have alcohol be a point of contention in my marriage.  I now it's futile.  He has never drunk enough to really crave it or have a routine, but when it's around and he's started, he only wants more.  Nothing matters.  For that reason we simply don't drink and he doesn't miss it as long as he hasn't started, but multiple texts offering it can make a difference, especially if they are well-timed on a weekend.\n\nDo any recovered alcoholics have input?  I want to tell her sorry you have no friends who want to drink all night, but my spouse is married to me.",

As a young adult, I abused alcohol (luckily, turns out I developed diabetes while sober and now if I try to drink I suffer 8 hour vomiting the next day even after just two beers.)  I moved in with an alcoholic who eventually after years knowing him sexually assaulted me by grabbing my ass.  I'm a straight guy and he was a guy and it was unwanted and unwarranted.  It was just grabbing my ass, so it's not horrific, but it's troubling none the less.\n\nI later worked at a hotel with staff housing.  My room mate was an alcoholic and often got aggressive when drunk.  I was about 20 years younger than him though, so it was just harrassment to deal with though on one occassion he cornered me.  He never had any recollection of it.\n\nNow, I live with another alcoholic.  3 drinks in and he acts like a total asshole that thinks the world revolves around him, and on multiple occassions has physically threatened me.\n\nLast night, I had enough and when he woke up sober I let into him.  Told him to hit me and let him know that I was done taking his abuse.  I told him I'd rather be fucking homeless than live with him because he half asses his way through life and thinks it's a fucking joke.\n\nI'm at the end of my rope here, and I'm not sure what I am looking for here.  I am certainly an alcoholic myself.  If my health allowed me to drink after I stopped being sober I'd be battling my own demons on this more than likely.\n\nWhat do I do?  Do I yet the fuck out of here?  Do I hope the guy on the lease takes action (a 3rd person in this rental has all the responsibility on the lease?)  I know I can't sit here and take this shit anymore.\n\nSo, I turn to people better than him (and me. ) People that beat it, and that now what he is gonna do.  He has not hit rock bottom yet.

My uncle fucked up his life because of the alcohol, and maybe my grandmother, mother and other uncle are alcoholic. (Right now I'm dating a \"recovered\" alcoholic.)\n\nI had my first beer (accidentally) at 9 years old. I didn't drink again until I was 19 or something like that. Right now I am 24.\n\nI've always been afraid of alcohol, of drunk people and of getting drunk. There are countless reasons for this. But I've always known that I COULD be an alcoholic because of my genes.\n\nI've become quite fond of beer and like pretty much any alcohol, except vodka. However, I only drink in very controlled environments: alone, with my mother, or with my boyfriend.\nIn the last five years or so, I've built up my tolerance to the point where I can happily drink 6 common beers, 6 shots of brandy, 2 glasses of wine, and still be fine. (I weigh about 49 kilograms, or 108 pounds and I am a female) Beers are like water for me now, but I avoid drinking with coworkers or strangers in general because I'm afraid they'll judge the amount. \nI like beer (and the other alcohols) because of the taste. I am quite selective and try to become an expert in beer. I do not drink for the sake of the effects of alcohol, which I do not experience and do not wish to. At most, I'll feel dizzy and I'll stop. But that doesn't really happen anymore. Also, I drink a lot of water while I'm consuming alcohol.\n\nIn a week, I drink two to four days. Usually it's anything between a normal beer to six beers per day. So there are weeks when I consume 2, and weeks when I drink about 24 beers. Normally it's about 6 beers per week. \n\nI do not feel anxious if I cannot drink, and I have a lot of chronic health issues going on, but my first question is to the doctors is: \"Can I still drink while I'm on this medicine?\" Beer is the only thing I actually WISH to ingest; for some reason I've lost interest in food. I eat, but I'd rather drink. I can afford my consumption. I have always been a responsible student and employee. But a doctor said that, because of the amount of alcohol I drink per week, I qualify as an alcoholic.\n\nIs this possible?\nAm I an alcoholic in denial?\nDo I need help?\n\nSorry for the length and thank you.\n",

Normally it&amp;#39;s about 6 beers per week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not feel anxious if I cannot drink, and I have a lot of chronic health issues going on, but my first question is to the doctors is: &amp;quot;Can I still drink while I&amp;#39;m on this medicine?&amp;quot; Beer is the only thing I actually WISH to ingest; for some reason I&amp;#39;ve lost interest in food. I eat, but I&amp;#39;d rather drink. I can afford my consumption. I have always been a responsible student and employee. But a doctor said that, because of the amount of alcohol I drink per week, I qualify as an alcoholic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this possible?\nAm I an alcoholic in denial?\nDo I need help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the length and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
